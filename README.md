# Issue Tracker

### Description

The primary entity in the Issue Tracker is a ticket describing a user’s issue, and similar to Github’s issue tracker, it allows users to create tickets, comment on tickets, and show the status of the ticket (e.g. ‘to do,’ ‘doing,’ or ‘done’). As mentioned, issues come in two varieties – ‘bugs’ (which I’ll fix for free, eventually), and ‘features’ which are only developed if enough money is offered. Users will be able to upvote bugs (signifying ‘I have this too’), and upvote feature requests (signifying ‘I want to have this too’). While upvoting bugs is free, to upvote a feature request, users would need to pay some money to pay for time in working on it. In turn, at least 50% of time working will be spend on developing the highest-paid feature.
To offer transparency there is a page that contains some graphs showing how many bugs or features are tended to on a daily, weekly and monthly basis, as well as the highest-voted bugs and features.
